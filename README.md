# REI
I am still pretty new to Python, but I for Android/iOS I use Java and Swift. I decided Python may be a better fit for this type of application and I have been wanting a reason to use it more. However, there will likely be signs of my lack of Python experience in the code.

#Assumptions

The '-1' position is the default and where blocks are picked up or dropped off.

The robot already knows how to move to the appropriate physical location when given a position to move to.

The robot attempting to interact with conflicting positions is not fatal (For example, rm() on an exmpty slot), and would be avoided by user observation.

The inidicator of "X" for the satus of a slot means there is one recognized block per slot. This means 1 + 1 = 1.

The replay() command actually has a use. This may be an issue because of the assume 1 block per slot.
